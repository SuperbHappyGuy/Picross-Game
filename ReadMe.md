<p>Color in cells of a grid to reaveal a completed grid. You can also color in X's to eliminate options. Each line that is solved (or partially solved) provides new information that can help in solving the lines perpendicular to it. The most important rule of Picture Cross is to never guess! All the information needed to solve the puzzle is in the clues. For a more in depth explanation on solving a puzzle follow the link above.</p>

## Disclaimer
<p>The puzzles of Picross are normally based on pictures and where it gets it's name (Picture word cross). Due to the puzzles being randomly generated there is a chance that some puzzles will have multiple solutions, which is not intended. To combat this I added a mistake checker, this will ensure you get the correct puzzle solution every play!</p>

## Mistake Checker
<p>To check your mistakes in a puzzle fill in the entire grid with either colored cells or X cells to reveal red colored cells indicating your mistakes. Swap those inputs to get the correct solution. Mistakes will add an hour on to your final time but only if the grid is filled so don't worry about any prior mistakes!</p>
